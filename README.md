## Hi there <img width="35" alt="Waving emoji gif" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8993e63a-35ff-4b15-9537-d8be060c1d40" />

I’m a completely self-taught software developer, developing for legacy Windows operating systems like **Windows 7** and **Windows 8.1**, which are by the way my favourite systems and, in my opinion, the best operating systems ever released.
I generally develop in **Visual Basic .NET**, an easy to learn but also powerful programming language. My mostly used IDE for that is **Visual Studio 2012**, which works nicely and flawlessly on my system running Windows 8.1.

Just want to say that I really love $${\color{blue}Windows}$$ in general! It’s very close to being perfect, Windows is easy to use but also powerful at the same time.
